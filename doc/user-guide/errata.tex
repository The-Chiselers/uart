\section{Errata and Known Issues}

\subsection{Errata}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The baud rate is set by an interative divider. It can take up to 32 clock cycles to converge to a division result.
    \item The control signals are double buffered and will apply in the IDLE (or BAUD UPDATING for non-baud related signals) state of the state machines
    for both RX and TX modules. No software synchronization is required.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Known Issues}
None.
