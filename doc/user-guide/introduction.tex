\section{Introduction}
The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) IP core provides serial communication capabilities with highly configurable parameters. It supports full-duplex communication with independent transmit and receive paths, configurable through APB registers. The core includes features for baud rate generation, parity checking, and error detection, making it suitable for a wide range of embedded communication applications.
